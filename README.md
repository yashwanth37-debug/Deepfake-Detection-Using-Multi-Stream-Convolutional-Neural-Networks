# Deepfake-Detection-Using-Multi-Stream-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

In this work, we propose a novel multi-stream convolutional neural network architecture that integrates RGB appearance, frequency spectrum (FFT), and motion difference modalities. By utilizing attention mechanisms for feature enhancement and fusion, we effectively address the task of deepfake detection using facial video data extracted from synchronized frames.
